Airgeddon: Wireless Network Security Testing  
A Cyber Security Project for Intro to Cyber

This project explores wireless network security using **Airgeddon**, an advanced bash script for auditing and attacking Wi-Fi networks. The goal is to demonstrate various techniques used in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network security assessments.  

🔥 Features  
- Wireless Network Scanning – Identifies available networks and devices  
- Handshake Capture & Cracking – Captures WPA/WPA2 handshakes for offline analysis  
- Evil Twin Attacks – Creates rogue access points for phishing attacks  
- Deauthentication Attacks– Disconnects clients from a Wi-Fi network  
- Automated Workflow– Simplifies multiple attack techniques  

⚡ Setup & Usage  
1. Install **Airgeddon** on a compatible Linux system  
2. Use a **wireless network adapter** that supports monitor mode  
3. Run `airgeddon.sh` and navigate through the interactive menu  
4. Perform ethical penetration tests following responsible disclosure guidelines  

🔐 Ethical Considerations  
This project is for **educational and security research purposes only**. Unauthorized use of Airgeddon against networks without permission is illegal.  

🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Integrate AI-based detection for rogue APs  
- Develop a GUI-based interface for easier use
